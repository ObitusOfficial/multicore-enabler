# multicore-enabler
After many requests and thousand different UI's and different *FPS Boosters* I decided to put my version online. It is as any other, a multicore enabled that enabled multicore rendering on Garry's Mod. It is used for server owners that want their clients to get a popup once they are loaded in. The design is Discord-styled and has a lot of things different from the most on the workshop. This one features sounds, a chat notification so players actually have the feeling something happened. A custom UI and it is of course easy to customize. I have used this for my own servers aswell. Any bugs? Do not hesitate to contact me!
